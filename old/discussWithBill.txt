also, in terms of "phase Y being after phase X", here's my current list (left hand side comes before right hand side). care to rearrange?

note that not all phases are given below... these are just the ones that occur often enough to be graphed.

phases="BeforeDevelopment Planning Reqts ReqtsReview ReqtsInspect HLD HLDReview HLDInspect 
        Design DesignInspect Code CodeInspect TestCaseDevel TestCaseInspect  Test QualTest  IntTest SysTest AcceptTest ProductLife"
        
        is tsp more exepensive than otherwise?
